App Description

What the app does:
It is proven that drinking water helps to improve ur health lot. Actually if someone does not drink water it affects to one's health in a very bad way. So it is compulsary to drink ater daily. But today people have become really busy so that they forget to drink the required amount of water daily. So I thought of developing an application called "Water Yourself". This application tracks your level of drinking water. The user
can input the amount of water that his drinks at that moment through this app. Then the app will show the total amountof water that user has consumed.
This app has some more features like-
	gives you an alram that reminds the user to drink water.
	shows the user the level of water that he has already consumed 
	gives health tips regarding drinking water.
